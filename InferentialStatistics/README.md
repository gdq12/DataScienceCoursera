Overview
--------

This part of the repository contains coursework completed for the Statistical Inference course from John Hopkins University via Coursera. The purpose of this class, as quoted by the course description:"This course presents the fundamentals of inference in a practical approach for getting things done. After taking this course, students will understand the broad directions of statistical inference and use this information for making informed choices in analyzing data."

Since this was a theoretically heavy based course, a formula sheet was created as reinforcement of the concepts and quick reference to formulas and R code steps in the future.
