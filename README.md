Purpose of Repository 
---------------------

This repository consists material produced for the [Data Science Specialization by JHU via Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science). The course offers a foundation into the various task that is required in the field in data science as R program being the medium used to analyze and produce output for the material. 

The produced material (variation of Rcode, pdfs, markdown files etc.) are organized into sub folders in this repository based on the course they were required for. The material was originally submitted via the required platforms but this repository was created to consolidate all the work into a single source. Each sub folder contains **very** short text on the purpose of each course, further subfolders to divide the project work and README.md files for each project containing exact instructions of each project to give a background on the result material present within the same respective folders. 

For complete material of the specialization (slides, books etc.) is suggested to go to [this repo](https://github.com/bcaffo/courses).
