These are the exact instructions provided by course instructor when the project was completed in September 2020. The webpage result for this assignment can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/gdquiceno/656333), which was uploaded onto RPubs. 

## Instructions

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!
