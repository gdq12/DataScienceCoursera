- Each criteria is binary: (1 point = criteria met acceptably; 0 points = criteria not met acceptably)

Review Criteria 
---------------

Peer grading: 

- The criteria that your classmates will use to evaluate and grade your work are shown below.
- Each criteria is binary: (1 point = criteria met acceptably; 0 points = criteria not met acceptably)
- Take the mtcars data set and write up an analysis to answer their question using regression models and exploratory data analyses

Criteria: 

1. Did the student interpret the coefficients correctly?
2. Did the student do some exploratory data analyses?
3. Did the student fit multiple models and detail their strategy for model selection?
4. Did the student answer the questions of interest or detail why the question(s) is (are) not answerable?
5. Did the student do a residual plot and some diagnostics?

8. Did the report include an executive summary?
9. Was the report done in Rmd (knitr)? (PDF format)

Peer Grading: 

- The criteria that your classmates will use to evaluate and grade your work are shown below.
- Each criteria is binary: (1 point = criteria met acceptably; 0 points = criteria not met acceptably)
- Your Course Project score will be the sum of the points and will count as 40% of your final grade in the course.
