This part of the repository contains coursework completed for the Regression Modeling course from John Hopkins University via Coursera. The purpose of this class, as quoted by the course description:"This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. It will also cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing."

Since this was a theoretically heavy based course, a formula sheet was created as reinforcement of the concepts and quick reference to formulas and R code steps in the future.
